Description:

This script is question 1 in the final project for the course intro to numerical analysis

given an acoustic model with a uniform density and a source (that produces a waves) in at x = 3000 meters, z = 2800 meters

the domain is defined as:
0<=x<=6000 meters
0<=z<=6000 meters

there is a layer that defines the speed of the wave:
the layer given by series of points:
(x,z) = (0,2600), (1000,4000), (2600,3200), (4600,3600), (6000,2400)
the speed of the wave depends on the location of the wave with respect to the layer:
above the layer, the speed of the wave is c1 = 2000 m/s, and below the layer, the speed of the wave is c2 = 3000 m/s

the objective of this script is to solve a problem of the wave equation in 2D space:
    ∂^2u/∂t^2 = c^2(∂^2u/∂x^2 + ∂^2u/∂z^2) + F(x,z,t)

        where:
        u(x,z,t) is the wave function
        c is the wave speed
        F(x,z,t) is the source function
        x,z are the spatial coordinates
        t is the time coordinate

            the source function is given as:
            F(t) = t*exp(2*pi*t)*sin(2*pi*t) for  0<=t<=0.05
            F(t) = 0 for t>0.05
            the source location is at x=3000 meters, z=2800 meters

we will solve the wave equation in the explicit method


missions:

1) To represent the separation layer using cubic spline interpolation.
   *** Ensure that the velocity model is correct before solving the wave equation ***
2) Calculate the progression of the wave field in the medium using 4th-order finite difference for spatial steps and 2nd-order for time.
    *** Space step: Δx = Δz = 100 m, Time steps: Δt = 0.01 s and Δt = 0.03 s ***
    how the solution behaves with the time step Δt?
3) Show snapshots of the wave field at times
for Δt = 0.01 s at t = 0.15 s, 0.4 s, 0.7 s, 1 s
and
for Δt = 0.03 s at t = 0.15 s, 0.3 s, 0.6 s, 0.9 s .
4) Create a complete animation of the wave field for Δt = 0.01 s.
